                Variable: In programming, a variable serves as a labelled container for diverse data, such as numbers, text, or intricate structures. These containers can modify their contents as a program runs, enabling dynamic data manipulation.
                Constant: Conversely, constants resemble variables but with a significant divergence—they maintain a fixed value once defined. Constants are ideal for preserving unchanging values throughout a program’s operation.            </div>

                Compilation: Converting source code into machine code or an intermediate form is compilation. A compiler handles the entire program in one go and produces independent executable code.
                Interpretation: In contrast, interpretation means executing code step by step, translating and running each line as it appears. An interpreter processes the code sequentially.
                The main distinction is that compiled code is usually quicker because it’s pre-translated, whereas interpreted code offers flexibility and can run on any platform with the relevant interpreter. Commonly compiled languages include C++, while Python and JavaScript are typically interpreted languages.            </div>

                Arrays are a fundamental programming data structure, enabling the storage of multiple values of the same data type under a single variable name. Each element within an array is distinguished by an index, typically commencing at 0.

                Functions serve as fundamental components in programming. They enable you to divide your code into smaller, controllable segments, each intended to execute a distinct operation. Functions enhance the organisation, modularity, and reusability of your code. When creating a function, you identify a name, optional parameters, and the code the function runs. The provided code outlines a function named “add_numbers,” which accepts two inputs, adds them together, and provides the outcome. This function can be invoked with various values, making it exceptionally reusable.            </div>
